CHAPTER XXXV

Esthers Narrative


I lay ill through several weeks and the usual tenor of my life
became like an old remembrance But this was not the effect of time
so much as of the change in all my habits made by the helplessness
and inaction of a sickroom Before I had been confined to it many
days everything else seemed to have retired into a remote distance
where there was little or no separation between the various stages of
my life which had been really divided by years I",F,F,F,True

seemed to have crossed a dark lake and to have left all my
experiences mingled together by the great distance on the healthy
shore

think that they were unperformed were soon as far off as the oldest
of the old duties at Greenleaf or the summer afternoons when I went

station but by the great perplexity of endlessly trying to reconcile

The Letter and the Answer


My guardian called me into his room next morning and then I told him
what",F,F,F,True
"ch he scarcely doubted he
dreaded discovery He knew something of him both by sight and by
reputation and it was certain that he was a dangerous man Whatever
happened he repeatedly impressed upon me with anxious affection and
kindness I was as innocent of as himself and as unable to influence

Nor do I understand said he that any doubts tend towards you my

my mind since I have bee",F,F,F,True

will be attentive to what passes in that family so far as I can
observe it from my distance And if the time should come when I can
stretch out a hand to render the least service to one whom i",F,F,F,True

I have had some difficulty in approaching it and I still have I
should wish it to be so deliberately said and so deliberately
considered Would you object to my writing it

Dear guardian how could I object to your writing anything for ME to
read

Then see my love said he with his cheery smile am I at this
moment quite as plain and easydo I seem as open as honest and
oldfashionedas I am at any time

I answered in all earnestness Quite With the strictest truth for
his momentary hesitation was",F,F,F,True

the grace and beauty of my life I recalled the first bright gleam of
welcome which had shone out of those very windows upon our expectant
faces on that cold bright night and which had never paled I lived

unchanged and all this happiness shone like a light from one central

were reversed as if all the good deeds had been mine and all the
feelings they had awakened his It dwelt on my being young and he
past the prime of life on his having attained a ripe age while I
was a child on his writing to me with a silvered head and knowing
all this so well as to set it in full before me for mature
deliberation It told me that I would gain nothing by ",F,F,F,True
"such a marriage
and lose nothing by rejecting it for no new relation could enhance
the tenderness in which he held me and whatever my decision was he
was certain it would be right But he had considered this step anew
since our late confidence and had decided on taking it if it only
served to show me through one poor instance that the whole world

But he did not hint to me that when I had been better looking he had
had this same proceeding in his thoughts and had refrained from it
That when my old face was gone from me and I had no attractions he
could love me just as well as in my fairer days That the discovery
of my ",F,F,F,True
"birth gave him no shock That his generosity rose above my
disfigurement and my inheritance of shame That the more I stood in
need of such fidelity the more firmly I might trust in him to the
last

But I knew it I knew it well now It came upon me as the close of
the benignant history I had been pursuing and I felt that I had but
one thing to do To devote my life to his happiness was to thank him
poorly and what had I wished for the other night but some new means
of thanking him

Still I cried ver",F,F,F,True

I thought all at once if my guardian had married some one else how
should I have felt and what should I have done That would have been
a change indeed It presented my life in such a new and blank form
that I rang my housekeeping keys and gave them a kiss before I laid
them down in their basket again

Then I went on to think",F,F,F,True

room and burned them at the candle and they were dust in an instant

On entering the breakfastroom next morning I found my guardian just
as usual quite as frank as open and free There being not the
least constraint in his manner there was none or I think there was
none in mine I was with him several times in the course of the
morning in and out when there was no one there and I thought it
not unlikely that he might speak to me about the lette",F,F,F,True

were upon a raw misty morning The long flat beach with its little
irregular houses wooden and brick and its litter of capstans and

of his probable return to India He said that was very doubtful He

had gone o",F,F,F,True

I felt the blood rush into my face for the first time but it was
only an instantaneous emotion I turned my head aside and it was
gone

face such a singular expression I never saw so remarkable a look in
a young person One cannot say that it is all anxiety or all
weariness yet it",F,F,F,True

mine in thanks

And in his last look as we drove away I saw that he was very sorry
for me I was glad to see it I felt for my old self as the dead may
feel if they ever revisit these scenes I was glad to be tenderly
remembered to be gently pitied not to be quite forgotten
